SecureStreets: A Data-Driven Approach to Crime Prediction
This project, "SecureStreets," applies machine learning to analyze and forecast crime patterns based on historical data. By analyzing historical crime data, the project aims to identify crime-prone areas and types, providing valuable insights that can assist in resource allocation and public safety strategies. The project uses popular Python libraries to build and evaluate predictive models, demonstrating a practical application of machine learning in a critical social domain.
